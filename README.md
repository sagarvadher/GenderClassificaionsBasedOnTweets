GenderClassificationsBasedOnTweets

Abstract
------------------
The idea behind the project is to find or address a pattern in tweets among the male and female twitter users.

Dataset
--------------------
The twitter dataset was downloaded from Kaggle website and it can be found under the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-user-gender-classification .
The dataset have twenty thousand entries.

Goal
------------
The goal of the research project is to predict the gender of the user based on their fields. 
There is a pattern for most of the male and female tweeters that needed to be find. That pattern needed to be addressed. 
The goal of the final project was not to have an algorithm that can calculate or perform prediction with a 100% accuracy, but something with a better accuracy then a random guess can work.
Any individual that is an active twitter user or tweets, will use the same language or speech in their tweet that they use while speaking or engaging in conversation. 
If we can get a good accuracy in the project, then we can also apply this algorithm outside twitter and tweets and use it in real life to classify men and women from their speech or thoughts. 
Classifying in such a way can be proven useful in many ways.

Approach
------------
Initially, popular text mining algorithm TFIDF algorithm is implemented that helped to find out the words that are occuring most in the tweets of male users as well as female users. Later, different classifier algorithms were used to find out the highest accuracy yielding algorithm.
